## About the Project

The **Stock Market Price Trend Prediction and Backtesting Strategy System** is a full-stack financial intelligence platform designed to bridge the gap between retail investors and institutional participants. The system provides real-time stock data, ensemble-based price prediction, portfolio tracking, AI-powered equity research, sentiment-driven news classification, and a query-based stock screener — all within a single unified platform.

The platform supports three distinct user roles: **Customer**, **Financial Institution**, and **Admin**, each with tailored capabilities and access controls.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12** — [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **uv** (fast Python package manager) — Install with:
  ```bash
  pip install uv
  ```
  Or using the official installer(pip command above is faster and error free):
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
  > On Windows, use: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitUnni/stock-market-trend-prediction-system.git
cd stock-market-trend-prediction-system
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment using uv

```bash
uv venv
```

> No need to manually activate the virtual environment. `uv run` (used in the next steps) automatically resolves and uses the project's `.venv` for you without any conflicts. If you have installed python extension in vscode then it will automatically activate virtual environment each time a new terminal is opened. To deactivate it simply type the below command: 

```bash
deactivate
```
> This will deactivate any conflicting virtual env and run cleanly the `.venv` we will use `uv run` (used in the next steps)

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will install all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`, including FastAPI, Prophet, XGBoost, PyTorch (LSTM), LangChain, and all other required packages.

### 4. Set Up the Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `app/` folder:

```bash
# Navigate to the app folder
cd app

# Create the .env file (Linux/macOS)
touch .env

# Or on Windows
type nul > .env
```

Then populate it with your keys (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).

---

## Environment Variables

Create a file at `app/.env` with the following contents. Replace each `your_key` / `your_gmail` with your actual credentials without any space and `""`:

```env
# Groq API key — used in research.py for AI-powered Equity Research Tool
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key

# Tavily API key — used in research.py for web search during equity research (monthly refresh)
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key

# MarketAux API key — used in news.py for fetching Indian & Global market news (daily refresh)
MARKETAUX_API_KEY=your_key

# Gmail credentials — used in routes/auth.py for sending verification/notification emails
sender_email=your_gmail
sender_password=your_key

# Secret key — used in auth.py for JWT token signing and session security
SECRET_KEY=your_key
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It is already listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure.

### Where to Get Each Key

| Key | Source |
|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) — Free tier available |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | [https://app.tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com) — Free tier available (monthly refresh) |
| `MARKETAUX_API_KEY` | [https://www.marketaux.com](https://www.marketaux.com) — Free tier available (daily refresh) |
| `sender_email` | Your Gmail address used to send system emails |
| `sender_password` | Gmail App Password (not your regular password) — Generate at [Google Account → Security → App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Any long random string — generate with: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |

---

## Running the Application

From the **root directory** of the project (where `pyproject.toml` is located), run:

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The application will start at: **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**

- `--reload` enables hot-reloading during development (auto-restarts on code changes)
- To run on a different port: `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080`

---

Individual scripts to run for populating the database after running 
```bash      
uv run python -m app.sync_stocks		#Scraping NSE's stock data into stock_info table daily update
uv run python -m app.manualadd			#Adding admin manually
uv run python -m app.update_stock_metrics	#Stock metrics daily update
```

## User Roles

### Customer
Registers directly and gets immediate access to stock search, price prediction, backtesting, screener, and news features after email verification.

### Financial Institution
Registers and submits a request for approval. **The account remains inactive until the Admin approves the request.** Upon approval, the Financial Institution gains access to portfolio management, equity research, and news features.

### Admin
A pre-configured admin (manualadd.py) account manages user oversight, approves or rejects Financial Institution registration requests, and can delete users from the system.

---

## Database & Migrations (Production)

For production deployment (e.g., Render), use **PostgreSQL** instead of SQLite.

### 1) Set DATABASE_URL

Set `DATABASE_URL` in your deployment environment (example with Neon):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>?sslmode=require
```

> Local development can still use SQLite by leaving `DATABASE_URL` unset.

### 2) Run Alembic migrations

This project now includes Alembic config and an initial migration.

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```


### Existing SQLite database already has tables?

If your database was created before Alembic (tables already exist), run:

```bash
alembic stamp head
```

`stamp` marks the current schema version without trying to recreate tables.
After stamping, future schema changes should use normal migrations (`revision` + `upgrade`).

### 3) Create new migrations when models change

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
alembic upgrade head
```

Use migrations for schema changes instead of `Base.metadata.create_all(...)` in app startup.
